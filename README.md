# PasswordGenerator

Password generator with 5 categories that are selectable
4 to 50 characters in length
include numbers
include symbols
include lowecase characters
include uppercase characters

User will be prompt via console for their selection

This project helped me understand dependency injection better
Also it taught me how to use polymorphism
I had to store password rule objects that has a different set of characters
I used polymorphism to change the behavior of the logic when looping through a list of options objects
Built in C# .NET 8.0
